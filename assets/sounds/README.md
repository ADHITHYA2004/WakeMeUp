# Alarm Sound Files

This directory should contain the default alarm sound files used by the app.

## Required Sound Files

The following sound files should be placed in this directory:

1. `classic_alarm.mp3` - A classic alarm sound
2. `gentle_wake.mp3` - A gentle wake-up sound
3. `beep_beep.mp3` - A beep-beep alarm sound
4. `chime.mp3` - A chime sound
5. `bell.mp3` - A bell sound

## Supported Formats

- MP3 (recommended)
- WAV
- M4A

## Note

If sound files are missing, the app will still function but default sounds won't be available. Users can still add custom sounds.

## Adding Sound Files

You can add your own sound files here. Make sure to:

- Use appropriate file names
- Keep file sizes reasonable (under 5MB recommended)
- Test the sounds to ensure they work properly
